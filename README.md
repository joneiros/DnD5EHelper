# DnD5EHelper

Android app for my Dungeons and Dragons play group.

## Archival Notes
This app is not usable, but it is useful to me to understand why I started it
and why I abandoned it, so that I hopefully I can focus future impact.

### Starting Goal
The design behind this app was to have a shared inventory and set of world notes
for the members of my Dungeons and Dragons group, which at the time had been
running for multiple years. We had had a couple situations where the player
maintaining the shared inventory had not been present during a session, or
where players in the group forgot important information about characters met
in-game, which hindered the goals of the party.

### Abandonment
This project was abandoned nearly immediately for the following reasons:

- TL;DR: Not worth the time or the effort.
- Lack of research led to poor product-market fit
    - The market users (my playgroup) was evenly split between using Android
    and iOS. Making an android app would not serve the group well
- Lack of Product differentiation
    - The only unique thing this app would have done for the group would have
    been to create a bespoke experience unique to our Dungeons and Dragons
    campaign. While fun, that goal is already achieved well through
    pencil and paper.
- Competitive market
    - This app would have been competing with
    [Roll20](https://roll20.net/) for D&D-specific features,
    with [Notion](https://www.notion.so/) for group workspace features,
    and with paper and pencil from a "comfort" and "ease-of-use" perspective.
- I underestimated the scope of the project.
    - My eyes were bigger than my stomach, thinking that the effort would be
    low compared to the reward when in fact the opposite was true.
